## What is this for?
Have you ever wanted blender simulations in source engine.
Newer source engine games like the cs:go and garrys mod branch support "vertex animations" but older ones like TF2 do not.
This is the only way to get baked simulations from blender into source for older engines.

This the 3.0 version of bonify which currently only supports rigidbody simulation export

I have rewritten the plugin from scratch for compatibility and ease of use.
I will update this plugin later to include the old "clothify" tool as well.


## How to install
   - Just like with any other blender plugin install the .zip file
   - Edit > Prefrences > Add-ons > Install
